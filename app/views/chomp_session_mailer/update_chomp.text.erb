<%= @chomp_session.name %> is updated!

Chomp code: <%= @chomp_session.public_uid %>

Chomping is now in progress...again...
You'll have to wait <%= pluralize(@chomp_session.session_expiry, 'hour') %> before a decision is made for you.
Whew! Didn't know you're so indecisive you have to change the meetup details.
Hopefully that was just to fix a typo... Right?
Meanwhile, continue doing whatever you were up to! Let us stress over where you should eat at instead.

Meetup details:
Date: <%= @chomp_session.date %>
Time: <%= @chomp_session.time.strftime("%I:%M %p") %>

Psst... Made a mistake again? <%= link_to "Click here", edit_chomp_session_url(@chomp_session) %> to edit the Chomp session details.
